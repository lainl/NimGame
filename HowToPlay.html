        Nim is played with several piles of objects, and players take turns removing any positive number of objects from exactly one pile. The game continues 
        until all objects are taken, and the winner is the one who removes the last object. A common winning strategy relies on calculating the “Nim-sum,” which
         is the bitwise XOR of the counts of objects in each pile; by making moves that leave a Nim-sum of zero, you can force the opponent into a losing 
         position.
